# House-Pricing-prediction-using-regression-model
This is a detailed and explained code that trains a machine learning model using regression to make predictions of housing prices using a dataset. 
You need to download a dataset for this code. 
I downloaded a dataset from kaggle and the csv file is also shared along with the Jupyter notebook.
All you need to do is keep your csv file in the same folder as your jupyter notebook and add the pah of your csv file in the code where the path is needed. 
Every step in the code is explained in the form of comments.
The accuracy of the model's prediction is also displayed in the form of a scatter plot using matplotlib library.
