# House-Pricing-prediction-using-regression-model
This is a detailed and explained code that trains a machine learning model using regression to make predictions of housing prices using a dataset. 
You usually need to download a dataset but in this code, we used sklearn.datasets to fetch california housing dataset.
Every step in the code is explained in the form of comments.
The accuracy of the model's prediction is also displayed in the form of a scatter plot using matplotlib library.
